# Decision Tree using Scikit Learn

## Introduction
Decision Tree is a widely used classification technique. A decision tree is a flowchart-like tree structure where an internal node represents feature, the branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents the outcome. It learns to partition on the basis of the attribute value.
